    I am a Lambda School student in the part time full stack web development class. 
    I have worked in healthcare for the past three years and decided I wanted a change in careers.
    I am a super beginner, only having taken a web development class in high school ten years ago! 
    I remember loving it then, I just never thought of it as a career option until now.
    I am liking the class so far, even if it is frustrating at times. I recently had an issue with my code that 
    I struggled with for over two hours. I chatted with my TL, had a zoom call with a classmate and still 
    was unable to locate the issue. Finally, after practically giving up my eyes just focused on an are of my 
    stylesheet link and I noticed it listed as styles.css. My file was called index.css. I couldn't believe
    such a small thing could trip me up so badly. Boy was it such a relief though to have figured it out!
    You better believe I'm gonna be more aware of my named items!
